## Introduction

We were interested in learning about resampling methods for irregularly spaced time series data. This led us to read the paper

\begin{quote}
"The Dependent Random Weighting" (2015) by Srijan Sengupta, Xiaofeng Shao, and Yingchuan Wang.
\end{quote}

The paper:
\begin{itemize}
\item Introduces a method that assigns random weights to the irregular time series data 
\item Incorporates a dependence structure that is similar to the data when assigning weights
\item Uses the weights when drawing bootstrap samples from the data
\end{itemize}

## Irregular Time Series Data

Irregular time series data can occur in two ways.

(1) Missing Values: Time series occurs at equally space intervals but not all data points are observed

(2) Unequal Intervals: Times when the data are observed are generated from a 1-D point process
