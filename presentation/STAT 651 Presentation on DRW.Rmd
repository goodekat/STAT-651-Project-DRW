## Introduction

We were interested in learning about resampling methods for irregularly spaced time series data. This led us to read the paper

\begin{quote}
"The Dependent Random Weighting" (2015) by Srijan Sengupta, Xiaofeng Shao, and Yingchuan Wang.
\end{quote}

The paper:
\begin{itemize}
\item Introduces a method that assigns random weights to the irregular time series data 
\vspace{0.25cm}
\item Weights are created using a dependence structure that mimics that of the observed data 
\end{itemize}

## Irregular Time Series Data

Irregular time series data can occur in two ways.

\vspace{0.25cm}

(1) Missing Values: Time series occurs at equally space intervals but not all data points are observed

\end{center}

\vspace{0.25cm}

(2) Unequal Intervals: Times when the data are observed are generated from a 1-D point process

## Our Simulations: Overview

We wanted to apply and compare DRW to methods learned in STAT 651. We decided to compare the following situations.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Methods}: DRW versus MBB
\vspace{0.25cm}
\item \textbf{Data}: MA versus AR time series
\vspace{0.25cm}
\item \textbf{Estimators}: mean versus median
\vspace{0.25cm}
\item \textbf{Bandwidth}: blocksize versus $l$-dependence
\end{itemize}

Note on irregular data type:
\begin{itemize}
\item Paper used unequal time intervals (type 2)
\vspace{0.25cm}
\item We used equal time intervals with missing values (type 1)
\end{itemize}

## Our Simulations: The Setup

In our simulations, we set...

\begin{itemize}
\item $n=200$
\item $M=500$
\item $K=1000$ 
\end{itemize}
